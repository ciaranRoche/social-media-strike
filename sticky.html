<p> Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted One moment Would you capture it or just let
it slip?</p>

<p> Yo His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but
on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes
so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now The clocks run out, times
up, over, blaow! </p>

<p> Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy?
No He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes It don't matter, He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke He's
so stacked that he knows When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him </p>

<p> You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss
your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it,
you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
you better </p>

<p> No more games, I'm a change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged I was playin' in the
beginnin', the mood all changed I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the
next cipher Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper All the pain inside amplified by the fact That I can't get by with
my nine to five And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy
diapers And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus </p>

<p> See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want
to Stay in one spot, another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot fore
I end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to
go I cannot grow old in Salem's lot So here I go is my shot. Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got </p>

<p> You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss
your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it,
you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
you better </p>

<p> You can do anything you set your mind to, man </p>

<h2> more words </h2>

<p> How much a dollar really cost? The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts Parasites in my stomach keep me with a
gut feeling, y'all Gotta see how Iâ€™m chillin' once I park this luxury car Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo 20 on pump six
dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo 20 years ago, can't forget Now I can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals Tenfold,
the liberal concept of what men'll do 20 on 6, he didn't hear me Indigenous African only spoke Zulu My American tongue was
slurry Walked out the gas station A homeless man with a silly tan complexion Asked me for ten grand Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin' He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it Told him, "Beat it" Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see
it He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated Listen to me, I want a single bill from you Nothin' less,
nothin' more I told him I ain't have it and closed my door Tell me how much a dollar cost It's more to feed your mind Water,
sun and love, the one you love All you need, the air you breathe He's starin' at me in disbelief My temper is buildin', he's
starin' at me, I grab my key He's starin' at me, I started the car and tried to leave And somethin' told me to keep it in
park until I could see A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him Like I'm the reason he's homeless
and askin' me for a favor He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare
is contagious Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin'
at his neck I never understood someone beggin' for goods Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could And this particular
person just had it down pat Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked Have you ever opened to Exodus 14? A humble
man is all that we ever need Tell me how much a dollar cost It's more to feed your mind Water, sun and love, the one you
love All you need, the air you breathe Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin' Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different I should distance
myself, I should keep it relentless My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'? So I'ma tell you like I
told the last bum, crumbs and pennies I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time I got better
judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin' Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's
old medicine Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin' Denzel
be lookin' at O'Neal Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up I seen you from a mile away losin'
focus And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy You looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet" I looked at him
and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep" He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free You're lookin' at
the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve Of Nazareth, and
I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God" I wash my hands,
I said my grace, what more do you want from me? Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be Shades of grey will
never change if I condone Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs</p>
